# Sparkify - Udacity DATA SCIENTIST CAPSTONE 

In this project the user data of a ficitional music streaming app called Sparkify was used to develop ML models that predict the customer churn of sparkify.

According to https://www.qualtrics.com/uk/experience-management/customer/customer-churn/ Customer Churn is defined as follows:
"Customer churn, also known as customer attrition, is when someone chooses to stop using your products or services. In effect, it's when a customer ceases to be a customer. "

Files
The project consists of two files:
 -Sparkify.ipynb ... notebook used to develop ML models
 - mini_sparkify_event_data.json ... file containing the user activity log data


 The repository must have a README.md file that communicates the libraries used, the motivation for the project, the files in the repository with a small description of each, a summary of the results of the analysis, and necessary acknowledgements.
